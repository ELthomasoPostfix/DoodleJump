# DoodleJump
A project for the course Advanced Programming for the University of Antwerp during the academic year of 2021-2022.

# How to run
A run.sh script is provided. This script will run cmake using the provided CmakeLists.txt file and build the project.
The executable will then be run.

Note that the file paths specified in resources.h require the executable to be run in a directory whose super directory
contains the Resources folder provided together with this project.

# Extra

Upon running the run.sh script, doxygen documentation will be generated into html/ and latex/ folders, created within
the doc folder, which is located at the same level as the Resources and src folders.

Note that the documentation contains a Credits page to credit the sources of inspiration/non-essential code and images.
